## Objective
Highly motivated Machine Learning Engineer with a proven track record in developing efficient data pipelines, benchmarking language models, and implementing reliable databases. Seeking to leverage my technical skills to effectively fill the Machine Learning Engineer role at your company.

## Experience

### **PIXSTORY - Machine Learning Engineer** (Aug 2023 – Present)
- Spearheaded the development of a data pre-processing pipeline for Pixstory’s Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) based conversation search, leveraging AWS Apache Airflow DAGs for efficient workflow management.
- Utilized large language models, performed quantization for faster inference, improving overall system efficiency.
- Conducted comprehensive benchmarking of various Language Model’s performance to ensure optimal results.
- Led the initiative in selecting a cost-effective and reliable vector database to enhance system efficiency.

### **PIXSTORY - Machine Learning Intern** (Jan 2023 – May 2023)
- Trained a transformer-based model to detect hate speech in 6 languages and implemented several approaches to get better recall and precision.
- Developed a RESTful API for data collection and integrated it with a database. The API was then hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance.
- Developed and implemented a dashboard to monitor annotator performance and ensure data quality.

### **LOYOLA MARYMOUNT UNIVERSITY – Graduate Research Assistant** (June 2022 – Dec 2022)
- Fine-tuned a transformer-based model using Hugging face transformer library and GPU hardware acceleration.
- Enhanced compatibility of a dataset for multi-label classification through meticulous annotation and leveraged the DALL·E API to collect a diverse range of images for further analysis.
- Fine-tuned VIT and BERT models with variety of evaluation methodologies to gain insight about model performances.
- Leveraged capabilities of Selenium Chrome Driver to efficiently scrape and extract valuable data from various online sources for further analysis and processing.
- Published paper at at <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10095762">IEEE ICASSP 2023 conference</a>.

### **IBM – Application Developer Bengaluru** (Dec 2019 – May 2021)
- Raised efficiency above 23% by identifying bottlenecks and removing redundancies in project requirements with suitable rules and fragments in CPQ tool with efficient algorithms.
- Assisted team in migrating to RedHat OpenShift platform; provided a secure and easy to use cloud platform.
- Led 5 minor releases, which improved quality of the product by avoiding long time wait for the changes.
